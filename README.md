Interactive Learning Environment
Web designing a website to educate students (High School and freshman) about computer science subjects in a fun and interactive way.
My main goal is to attract more students to the field of computer science by allowing his/her to see what computer science is all about. 
I first started programming in high school and fell in love with the excitement you get when you create a new program.  I want to share that same love for programming with people who are considering going into the field of computer science. 
I would love to hear from others about how I can introduce these topics in an exciting way. You can make a suggest, or add a comment about what you love about programming or how you came to be a programmer.

Thank You
