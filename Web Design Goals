Interactive Learning Environment  - Website Design

Project: To create a website to distribute entertaining, informative information about Computer Science in order to attract more people to the field.  The main target for this enterprise is high school students, to incoming freshman, who have yet to make up their mind about what fields to pursue in college. The main goal is to make Computer Science an attractive and appealing field. A side goal of the project is to increase the number of women in the field. 

Long-term Goals: To create a smart and interactive site that responds to a user needs in regards to subject material.  This will allow a user to customize his/her experience to get the most out of the material on the site.  (Why waste time on material you have already gone over if you have proven that you have mastered the subject material.)

Short-term Goals: To create an attractive functional website that goes over basic material about computer science.

Suggested Actions:

1. One of the first project to look at is a questioner about what students would look for in a website. How do they judge a website to be entertaining, informative, and interesting. Are these based on graphics, texts, pictures, animations, mobility, page-layout?   How can we these features work in our website?

2. Look for resources on the web to help increase the appeal of our website, from presentation websites (Haiku Deck) to free creative commons photos or graphics.
